# nx-chat-ao

An AO-only (Agent Orchestrator) chat block — a separate element from `nx-chat`
(see [`chat-ui-component.md`](./chat-ui-component.md) for the da-agent client),
not a variant of it. Built clean against AO's real wire protocol rather than
ported from da-agent's client, since the two backends' interaction models
(episodes, questions, permission requests) differ enough that sharing a
controller would mean branching throughout instead of a clean implementation
per backend. Which client loads for a given org/site is decided by
`loadChat()` in `nx2/utils/chat.js` (the `ew.coworker` flag, or the
`?nx-chat-ao=true` dev override).

Because either element can be mounted for a given org/site, `nx-chat-ao`
exposes `setPrompt(text, { autoSend? })` with the same signature as
`nx-chat`'s, and listens for the same `CHAT_EVENT.SET_PROMPT` document event
(see [chat-ui-component.md § Setting a prompt programmatically](./chat-ui-component.md#setting-a-prompt-programmatically))
so callers — including the `PANEL_EVENT.OPEN`/DA SDK `actions.setPrompt`
paths documented there — don't need to know which element they got, and
don't need to query for it either.

## Session warming

`AoChatController.warmSession()` (`ao-controller.js`) kicks the current
episode's backend session awake and attaches its WebSocket — called both as
soon as the user starts typing (so the orchestrator's cold start happens
during typing instead of after Send) and right after `_loadEpisode` loads or
switches to an episode (so the socket is listening immediately, not only
once the user does something — see
[Connection recovery](#connection-recovery) for why that matters).

- **Existing episodes only.** Warming a brand-new (no `episodeId` yet)
  session would create a real, persisted episode immediately — leaving an
  empty orphaned one behind if the user never actually sends anything.
- **At most once per episode.** `_warmedEpisodeId` naturally goes stale (and
  lets a fresh warm through) the moment `_episodeId` changes.
- **Opens the WebSocket too**, after the REST warm call — AO's own guidance
  is to sequence them, and connecting early means `sendMessage`'s later
  `_ensureSocket()` call just reuses an already-open (or already-connecting)
  socket instead of starting from scratch.
- **Sends ATTACH after connecting.** AUTH alone doesn't get `SESSION_READY`
  moving — AO only prepares the session (and replies with `SESSION_READY`)
  once it sees the connection's first op (`SESSION_INIT`/`USER_INPUT`/
  `RESUME`/`ATTACH`). `ATTACH` is the one built for exactly this: "join this
  episode, don't submit a turn."
- **Failures stay silent.** If the backend session isn't actually live yet,
  AO replies with an `ERROR` frame instead of `SESSION_READY`. `_onSessionError`
  only surfaces `ERROR_CONNECTION`/`ERROR_SESSION` to the user while
  `_blockedByActiveTurn` is true (see [Connection recovery](#connection-recovery)
  for why plain `_thinking` isn't enough), so a failed _warm_ attempt never
  shows up — `sendMessage` just connects (and attaches) fresh when the user
  actually sends.

`_ensureSocket()` coalesces concurrent callers (warming opening the socket
early, `sendMessage` needing it moments later) onto the same in-flight
connection attempt via `_connecting` — without this, a second call while the
first is still connecting would open a competing WebSocket.

**Not yet implemented:** warming a brand-new session. Extending past existing
episodes needs a way to avoid leaving an orphaned empty episode behind.

## Connection recovery

A closed WebSocket during a turn used to be treated as fatal — an immediate
"Error: connection closed" and `_done()`. That was wrong: AO's episode
session is durable server-side and can still be actively working (e.g.
mid-retry on a tool call) when the socket drops for an unrelated reason —
confirmed by a real case where the socket closed while AO was retrying a
`da__da_update_source` call (a `tool_call_end` with `success: false` and
`result: "...not executed — retrying."`, immediately followed by a fresh
`tool_call_detected` for the same tool, same turn), and the turn went on to
finish successfully server-side — visible only after a reload pulled the
real answer from REST history, since the live client had already given up
and stopped listening.

`_recoverFromClose()` reattaches (`_ensureSocket()` + `ATTACH`) once instead
of declaring the turn dead, and otherwise does nothing — `_thinking` stays
whatever it already was, so the UI keeps showing progress (if any) while
waiting for events over the reattached socket. A genuinely dead session
mid-turn still ends the turn correctly: it surfaces via the normal
`ERROR_CONNECTION`/`ERROR_SESSION` handling once reattached.

**Only reconnects automatically while a turn is actually in flight
(`_shouldReattachOnClose()`: `!_destroyed && _blockedByActiveTurn`) — an idle
close does nothing on its own.** This used to reattach unconditionally,
mid-turn or idle, so a tab sitting on an ended/idle episode would retry
forever: AO's `ATTACH` rejects a non-live episode only after running a
billable liveness check, and the rejection itself closes the socket — an
immediate, no-backoff retry loop against an episode that will never become
attachable again (a real production incident: flat user traffic, but a
runaway spike in that liveness check from idle tabs re-`ATTACH`ing roughly
once a second, for hours, after their one real message). There's no
"permanently idle" state for AO to signal either, since an episode is always
reopenable — the fix is entirely client-side: stop treating a rejection as
"retry immediately," and only reattach when there's an actual local reason
to.

**A suspended turn (pending question/plan/permission) doesn't count as
"in flight" here, even though `_thinking` is still true.** AO genuinely
reports the episode as idle while it's paused waiting on the user — there is
no active generation for a reattach to rejoin, so a socket drop during a
pending question/plan/permission used to reattach anyway, get the same
"not active (state=idle)" rejection as the idle-tab case above, and surface
it as a scary `Error: Cannot ATTACH to episode ...` — even though the popover
itself was working fine and needed no live socket (`answerQuestion`/
`respondToPlanApproval`/`respondToPermission` all already reconnect via
`RESUME` on demand when the user actually responds). `_shouldReattachOnClose()`
and `_onSessionError()` both gate on the existing `_blockedByActiveTurn`
getter (see [Episode switching](#episode-switching)) instead of bare
`_thinking`, so this case is now silent, same as the idle-tab case.

Those reasons are `warmSession()` (user starts typing, or an episode is
loaded/switched to — see [Session warming](#session-warming)) and
`reattachIfIdle()` (the tab regains visibility, via `chat-ao.js`'s
`visibilitychange` listener) — both best-effort, single-attempt, and gated
on there being no live socket already. This is what restores cross-client
live updates (see below) without the background retry cost: AO fans out
`SessionEvent`s to every WebSocket attached to an episode (not just the one
that submitted a turn), so a turn submitted from a _different_ client on the
same episode (e.g. AO's own "coworker" UI, open in another tab) renders here
too, live, as long as this client's socket stays attached — but only for as
long as that socket lasts. A known, accepted gap: a tab that stays visible
and idle the whole time (no typing, no visibility change) won't notice if
its socket drops, and stays quiet until the user does something. This is
also still not a heartbeat/keepalive mechanism — a connection that goes
silently stale without ever firing a `close` event (rare, but possible with
some NATs/proxies) still wouldn't self-heal.

**`user_message` closes the other half of the gap — rendering the human's
own prompt from the other client, not just the assistant's reply.**
Cross-client fanout alone would only get you the assistant's response
appearing live (`TEXT_DELTA`/`TOOL_CALL_*` don't gate on origin); the human's
own typed message needed its own event, and AO has one: `SessionEvent
.user_message()` (`agents/events.py`) streams `{ text, attachments,
client_message_id }` to _every_ subscriber, confirmed to include the
originating connection itself — AO does not exclude the sender, by design
(its own docstring: "`client_message_id` lets the originating client dedup
against its optimistic bubble while other tabs render fresh"). So
`sendMessage` generates a `crypto.randomUUID()`, stores it on the locally
(optimistically) rendered message as `clientMessageId`, and sends it on the
wire as `clientMessageId` (camelCase — confirmed against `ws_handler.py`'s
`_client_message_id()`, which reads exactly that key, distinct from the
snake*case `client_message_id` the \_event's* `data` payload uses).
`_handleServerEvent`'s `USER_MESSAGE` handler checks incoming
`data.client_message_id` against already-rendered messages: a match means
it's this client's own echo (skip, already shown); no match means it
originated elsewhere and gets appended fresh. Because this is purely
`episode_id`-keyed fanout with no per-connection/per-browser/per-session
distinction in the delivery path, it makes no difference whether the other
client is a different browser, an incognito window, or a different device —
only successfully authenticating and being authorized for that episode
matters, same as any other access to it.

Not yet handled: a cross-client turn doesn't set `_thinking` locally (nothing
currently does, for a turn we didn't submit), so no "Thinking..." indicator
shows while waiting for the _first_ token of a reply typed elsewhere — the
response still streams in via `TEXT_DELTA` once AO starts producing it, just
without that lead-in cue. Deliberately not built yet, pending real usage.

## Episode switching

`switchEpisode`/`startNewEpisode` (`ao-controller.js`) are blocked by
`_blockedByActiveTurn`, which is true only while `_thinking` **and** there's
no pending question. A pending question means the turn is merely suspended
(not actively streaming) — AO persists it durably, so it's safe to abandon
and pick back up later; `_loadEpisode` re-hydrates it via
`fetchEpisodeContext`. Only genuinely in-flight generation should block
switching away.

`_loadEpisode` clears messages and sets `_loadingEpisode = true` synchronously
_before_ fetching, so switching feels instant rather than leaving stale
messages on screen for however long the fetch takes.

**`_refreshEpisodeList` never overwrites a known list with an empty one.**
`fetchEpisodes` (`utils/episodes.js`) collapses every failure mode — a
non-ok response, a thrown error — into a plain `[]`, indistinguishable from
"you genuinely have zero episodes." But `_refreshEpisodeList` only ever runs
right after `SESSION_READY` reports a new episode id, meaning at least one
episode (the one that was just created) must exist — so an empty result
there can only mean the fetch itself failed. Without the guard, one transient
failure (a network blip, a token-refresh race) at exactly that moment would
wipe the _entire_ session picker, not just fail to add the new episode —
confirmed as a real bug report (2026-08-25): starting a second new session
made the first one disappear from the picker entirely, not just show
untitled or out of order.

**`EPISODE_TITLE_UPDATED` upserts instead of only patching.** It used to only
`.map()` an existing entry, so if the episode wasn't already in `_episodes`
yet — `_refreshEpisodeList`'s fetch for it hadn't resolved, or failed — the
title had nothing to match and was silently dropped; the picker only ever
picked it up after a full reload re-fetched everything from scratch. Now, if
the episode isn't found, a new `{ id, title }` entry is inserted at the front
(matching `fetchEpisodes`' most-recent-first order) instead of no-op'ing, so
the picker reflects the title live regardless of whether the other fetch
path ever succeeded. A missing/falsy title with no existing entry is still a
genuine no-op — there's nothing useful to insert (bare id, no label).

## Question flow

AO pauses a turn by sending a `USER_QUESTION`/`question` event (see the
[AO wire-protocol note](#ao-wire-protocol-notes) below on the event-name
discrepancy) — this is the only shape AO sends for a "should I proceed?"
pause today; no separate permission-request concept has shown up in practice
for this client.

**Responding to a resumed question — cold vs. warm connection.** `_respondToQuestion`
checks whether the socket was already open _before_ sending:

- **Already open** (mid-session): send `QUESTION_RESPONSE` directly.
- **Not open** (e.g. the episode was restored from REST and has no live
  socket): a bare `QUESTION_RESPONSE` is rejected by AO as an invalid first
  op on a fresh connection. Wrap it in the generic `RESUME` op instead —
  `{ type: 'RESUME', turn_id, data: { type: 'question-response', answers, declined } }`
  — which AO accepts as a first op and dispatches by `data.type`.

**Rendering `context`/`question` text.** AO's question/context payloads
sometimes carry literal backslash-n sequences instead of real newlines, which
`parseMarkdown` would otherwise render as visible `\n` text rather than
paragraph breaks. `question-card.js` runs both fields through
`unescapeLiteralNewlines` (`utils/markdown.js`) before `renderMarkdown` — not
folded into `renderMarkdown` itself, since it's a quirk of these specific AO
fields, not a general markdown-rendering concern (regular assistant text
doesn't need it). For the same reason, the `context`/`question` containers
are `<div>`s, not `<p>`s — markdown output can itself contain block elements
(paragraphs, lists), which can't validly nest inside a `<p>`.

**"Other" is a real, grouped radio/checkbox** (`question-card.js`), not a
separate free-standing text field — this is what makes Tab/Arrow-keys/
Space/Enter work identically for every option in the group, with no custom
keyboard-nav code. The one thing the radio's own `@change` handler must
**not** do is jump focus into its paired text field: arrow-key movement in a
native radiogroup always both moves _and_ selects, so auto-focusing the text
field on selection meant arrowing onto "Other" (even just passing through)
yanked focus out of the group entirely, trapping keyboard users there.
Reaching the text field to actually type is one more Tab press, the same as
moving between any two distinct native controls — and only _typing_ in it
(never merely focusing/tabbing through) marks it as the chosen answer, so
passing through on the way to Submit never clobbers a previously-picked fixed
option.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- **Enter** on a fixed option mirrors Space (a native no-op on radio/checkbox)
  and also submits once that answer satisfies every required question.
- **Enter** on "Other" does the same, but moves focus into the text field
  first when there's nothing typed yet to submit.
- **Escape** mirrors clicking Skip, from anywhere in the card.

**Once answered, the question card is replaced by a `questionResponse`
summary message** (`renderQuestionResponseCard`) — not a plain `{role: 'user',
content}` bubble, which would misrepresent a selection as something the user
typed, and not left as no trace at all, which is what happened before this
existed (the card just vanished; the only record was the answer buried
inside `ask_user_question`'s own tool-call result, one expand-and-scroll
away). Three paths build the same message shape:

- **This client answers:** `_respondToQuestion` builds it immediately from
  the `pendingQuestion` it's about to clear plus the `answers`/`declined`
  being sent — optimistic, same principle as `sendMessage` rendering the
  user's own typed text before the round trip completes.
- **A different client answers first:** AO fans out `user_question_response`
  (`{ turn_id, answers }`) to every client on the episode, sender included —
  same pattern as `user_message`'s cross-client fanout. `_onUserQuestionResponse`
  only acts if `pendingQuestion` is *still* set for that turn — if this client
  already answered, it cleared its own `pendingQuestion` already, so the echo
  is a no-op here. That field carries no `declined` flag, unlike the
  optimistic path which knows the real value directly — an empty `answers`
  array is treated as declined, true for a real decline and for a required
  question somehow answered with nothing, which shouldn't happen in practice.
- **Reload:** `turnsToMessages` (`utils/episodes.js`) finds `ask_user_question`
  tool calls in a turn's events, matches each to its `tool_result` by
  `tool_call_id`, and rebuilds the same shape from the call's own `arguments`
  (`questions`/`context`) and the result's `metadata` (`answers`/`declined`) —
  the same `_build_question_metadata` shape AO already writes for this
  exact call, not a new field.

**Live, `ask_user_question` never gets a generic tool-call card** —
`_onToolCallDetected`/`_onToolCallStart` skip any tool name in
`DEDICATED_SUMMARY_TOOLS` (`ao-constants.js`), and `turnsToMessages` routes it
to `questionResponse` on reload too. The alternative (showing both) would mean
answering a question left *two* records behind: a raw, unformatted tool-call
card with the question JSON as `arguments` and "User answers: ..." as
`result`, and the readable summary above it — worse than either alone.

This suppression is deliberately *not* mirrored in `extractToolCalls`, used
only when a reloaded turn's collapsed "Used N tools" row is expanded — that
view already shows every other tool's raw args/result, so `ask_user_question`
appearing there too is consistent rather than a special case.

**Not yet implemented / open TODOs:** screen-reader verification, multi-question
layout testing under real content, focus-ring polish.

## Plan approval

AO suspends a turn with `plan_approval_request` (`data: { turn_id, plan_file_path,
plan_content }`) when the agent wants sign-off on a plan before acting on it.
Unlike the question flow, this renders **inline in the message log**
(`.chat-messages-container`), not as a card floating over the input — a plan
is read-heavy prose the user is meant to actually read, so it fits better as
part of the conversation than as a popup competing for space with the
textarea. `chat-ao.js`'s `renderPlanApprovalCard` shows it in place of the
"Thinking..." indicator, with the plan content run through `renderMarkdown`,
a feedback text input, and Approve/Reject buttons.

**Responding always uses `RESUME`, with no cold/warm distinction.** Plan
approval has no dedicated response frame of its own — the server dispatches
by `data.type` inside the generic `RESUME` op:

```json
{ "type": "RESUME", "turn_id": "...", "data": { "type": "plan-response", "decision": "approve"|"reject", "feedback": "...", "edited_plan_content": null } }
```

This is simpler than the question flow: `RESUME` is always a valid _first_
op (unlike a bare `QUESTION_RESPONSE`), so `respondToPlanApproval` never
needs to check whether the socket was already open before sending.

**REST hydration** (`fetchEpisodeContext`, restoring a suspended episode) is
a discriminated result now — `{ type: 'question', ... }` or
`{ type: 'plan', turnId, planContent, planFilePath }` — read from
`suspendedTurn.questionData` or `suspendedTurn.planData` respectively
(confirmed against AO's actual `_serialize_suspended_turn` in
`apps/a2a/api/routes/episodes.py`; `planData` is
`{ planContent, planFilePath }`, camelCased on the wire). `_loadEpisode`
hydrates whichever one AO reports into `_pendingQuestion`/`_pendingPlanApproval`.

**Genuinely non-blocking — the input stays enabled.** Unlike a pending
question, a pending plan approval does _not_ disable the chat input.
`chat-ao.js`'s `_blocked` getter (`thinking && !pendingPlanApproval`) is what
every input-disabling/send-blocking site checks instead of raw `thinking` —
the textarea's `disabled` state, `_submit`'s stop-vs-send branch, `_sendPrompt`,
and `ao-controller.js`'s own `sendMessage` guard. A pending question still
uses raw `thinking` and stays blocking, unchanged.

This isn't just a UI preference — AO has a real backend mechanism,
`conversational_resume` (`agents/config/base.py`, off by default, not yet
enabled for `experience-workspace`), that resolves a suspended turn (plan
approval, question, permission) from an ordinary free-text reply instead of
requiring the structured frame. Once enabled, a user can just type "looks
good" into the normal input instead of clicking Approve. Until then, a
message sent while a plan is pending is simply treated as a new, unrelated
turn — the plan card doesn't clear itself in that case, since we don't know
whether the reply was actually about the plan.

Because there's no dedicated event marking "the plan was resolved via
conversational text" (it just looks like an ordinary resumed turn once
`conversational_resume` picks it up), `_handleServerEvent`'s `TEXT_DELTA`
branch also clears `_pendingPlanApproval` defensively — text streaming again
means the turn resumed one way or another, so the card would otherwise linger
with nothing left to click.

Both pending questions and pending plan approvals are still exempted from
`_blockedByActiveTurn`, so switching episodes or starting a new one while
either is awaiting a decision is allowed — the turn is durably suspended
server-side regardless of whether the local input is disabled.

## Permission requests

AO suspends a turn with `permission_request` (`data: { turn_id, pending_calls:
[{ id, name, arguments, needs_permission }] }`) when a tool call needs
explicit sign-off before it runs — confirmed live (2026-08-26) for
`da__da_copy_content`, previously unhandled here entirely. Verified directly
against AO's backend source (`agents/events.py`, `agents/ops.py`,
`apps/a2a/ws_handler.py`, `agents/tool_executor/{suspend,suspensions}.py`):

- **Response wire shape**: `{ type: 'PERMISSION_RESPONSE', turn_id, decisions:
{ [pending_calls[].id]: { tool_call_id, approved } } }` — bare on an
  already-open connection, wrapped as `{ type: 'RESUME', turn_id, data: {
type: 'permission-response', decisions } }` on a cold one, identical
  cold/warm split to `QUESTION_RESPONSE`.
- **One-shot, not incremental.** Submitting `PERMISSION_RESPONSE` resolves
  the _entire_ gate for that turn immediately — any `pending_calls[].id` not
  present in `decisions` at that moment is auto-denied server-side, not
  re-prompted. So `respondToPermission` collects one decision per call
  locally (`_pendingPermission.decisions`) and only sends once every call in
  `pending_calls` has one; sending after the first click, before the rest
  are decided, would silently deny whatever's left.
- **No "always approve"/remember-my-choice mechanism exists for this at
  all** — correcting an earlier, wrong assumption from prior research this
  session (based on misattributed `scope`/`canRemember` findings that don't
  actually appear anywhere in this code path). `PermissionDecision` has no
  `scope` field. The real "don't ask again" behavior is entirely automatic
  and server-side: approving a destructive tool once auto-approves repeats
  of _that same tool by name_ for the rest of the current turn only,
  resetting on the next turn (`PermissionGate`/`TurnContext.requires_permission`
  in `agents/session/.../turn.py`). There is nothing for a client to opt into
  — no "remember this" button is possible here, unlike nx-chat's old
  (confirmed non-functional, since removed) "Always approve".
- **Blocking, like the question flow, not like plan approval.** A pending
  permission request is added to `_blockedByActiveTurn`'s exemption list
  (safe to abandon and resume later, same as question/plan), but `sendMessage`
  is not given a carve-out the way plan approval has one — typing something
  else while a destructive action is awaiting sign-off isn't offered as an
  alternative to actually deciding.
- **REST-hydrated on reload, same as question/plan** — via a field that
  turned out to already be there. `GET /api/v1/episodes/{id}/context`'s
  `suspendedTurn.pendingCalls` is _always_ present in the response (unlike
  `questionData`/`planData`, which are reason-specific), but only non-empty
  when the suspend reason is permission — same `{id, name, arguments,
needs_permission}` shape as the live event's `pending_calls`. An earlier
  version of this doc assumed no such field existed and shipped without
  rehydration; that assumption was never actually checked against AO's REST
  response and turned out to be wrong. `fetchEpisodeContext` now returns a
  `type: 'permission'` result whenever `pendingCalls.length`, and
  `_loadEpisode` rebuilds `_pendingPermission` from it (with a fresh, empty
  `decisions` map — any local progress on partially-decided calls from
  before the switch/reload wasn't submitted, so it's gone either way).
- **The "Loaded schema for X; not executed — retrying" message is normal,
  deterministic AO behavior — not a timing issue, and not something to
  special-case.** Verified against `agents/tool_execution_request.py` and
  `agents/tool_executor/executor.py`: some tools are "blind deferred" (their
  schema isn't preloaded). The permission check always runs _before_ the
  schema-load check, so a permission-gated tool suspends for permission
  first regardless of how long that takes; only once resumed does execution
  reach the schema-load step, which — the _first_ time only — returns this
  message as a non-generic failure (`success: false`) and retries with a
  fresh `tool_call_id`. That retry then succeeds without asking permission
  again, purely because of the same-tool-name-for-the-rest-of-the-turn
  mechanism above, nothing retry-specific. AO's own reference frontend
  doesn't special-case this message either — it renders as a plain failed
  attempt, same as any other tool-call error. Left unspecial-cased here too,
  matching that precedent, rather than inventing a softer treatment AO's own
  UI doesn't bother with.

`renderPermissionCard`/`renderPermissionRow` (`renderers.js`) and the card's
positioning (`chat-ao.css`) deliberately match nx-chat's own
`renderApprovalCard`/`.approval-actions` — same floating-over-the-input
placement (`position: absolute`, `.chat-form-wrap`-relative, verbatim the
same offsets `question-card.js` already uses) and the same box treatment
(background/border/shadow, tool-name-then-summary-then-right-aligned-buttons
layout) — visual parity is intentional, but it's independent code, not
shared, per this component's standing rule. No "Always approve" button, per
the point above.

A tool call's `arguments` can be a large raw blob (a real case: a full
rendered-HTML page body as one of the arguments) — capped the same way this
file already caps other raw-content dumps: `.permission-row-detail` gets
`.tool-call-detail`'s exact treatment (`max-height: 120px; overflow-y:
auto`), and `.permission-card` itself gets `.question-card`'s exact
treatment (`max-height: 60vh; overflow-y: auto`) so Approve/Reject stay
reachable by scrolling the card, rather than the whole thing overflowing
off-screen.

## Markdown rendering

`renderMarkdown` (`utils/markdown.js`) shares `parseMarkdown`
(`shared/chat/markdown.js`) with `nx-chat` — same `remarkGfmNoLink` parser,
which intentionally suppresses GFM autolink literals. That means a bare URL
in AO's response text (e.g. "see https://example.com for details") would
otherwise render as inert plain text. `renderMarkdown` runs the same
`linkifyBareUrls`/`sanitizeLinks` pass as `chat/renderers/renderers.js`
(`chat/utils/links.js`) to fix that — this isn't a da-agent-specific
customization, it's compensating for a parser choice both blocks share, so
both need it.

## Tool-call activity

AO streams three WS events per tool call — `tool_call_detected` (name only,
before args are ready), `tool_call_start` (`{tool_call_id, tool_name,
arguments}`), `tool_call_end` (`{tool_call_id, result, success, duration_s}`)
— all keyed by `tool_call_id`, verified against `agents/events.py` and
`tool_executor/executor.py` in AO's backend. This is generic across every
tool type (native, MCP, skill, code-exec); no manifest opt-in is needed to
receive them.

`ao-controller.js` handles all three events, patching the same
`{ role: 'assistant', toolCall: {...} }` entry in `_messages` in place by
`toolCallId` — always looked up by id rather than array index, since
`_messages` can be replaced out from under an in-flight patch (e.g. while
`hydrateToolCall`'s own fetch is still pending) — `tool_call_detected`
appends the entry (`status: 'detected'`, name
only, no args yet); `tool_call_start` upgrades it to `status: 'running'` with
`arguments`, appending fresh only if no `detected` row arrived first (AO
doesn't guarantee `detected` fires before `start`); `tool_call_end` upgrades
it again to `status: 'success'`/`'error'` with `result`. No event is skipped
— `detected` gets the card on screen (and the "Using X" label locked in) as
early as possible, before AO even has the tool's arguments ready. Both start
and end also carry `data.metadata.skill_title` for a `skill` tool call —
surfaced as `toolCall.title` and preferred over the raw `tool_name` ("skill")
in the card's summary line, so a skill invocation reads as e.g. "AEM Sites DA
Page Update" instead of "skill".

**No error badge, by design — `status` is never rendered as a visual
distinction, only as a `tool-call-${status}` class hook.** `success: false`
on the wire is a much noisier signal than "the user should worry about
this": it also covers AO's blind-deferred-schema retry (a tool's schema
isn't preloaded past `inline_schema_token_budget`; the first call in an
episode comes back `success: false`, `result` starting with `"Loaded schema
for "`, then retries and succeeds — normal, deterministic, not a failure)
and a user's own permission denial (`result` starting with `"<system-info>
User denied permission"` — the user's deliberate choice, not something gone
wrong). An earlier version of this doc had `ao-controller.js`/`episodes.js`
detect the deferred-schema case specifically (via `isDeferredSchemaResult`,
matching that one string) and map it to a `'retrying'` status so no badge
showed — but the permission-denial case proved that was one instance of a
pattern, not a one-off: `success: false` doesn't reliably mean "alarm the
user," and detecting each non-alarming case as it's discovered doesn't
scale. Removed rather than extended — the assistant's own reply is already
the channel a user reads for "did this work," and doesn't need a wire-level
heuristic to get it right.

`chat-ao.js`'s `renderToolCallCard` is a small collapsible `<details>` (styled
after this file's own existing `.selection-context` chevron pattern, not
copied from anywhere) — collapsed by default. **The summary label ("Using
&lt;name&gt;") never changes across detected → running → done**, and neither
does its styling regardless of outcome — only the expandable detail
(arguments while in progress, result once done) changes, so the line doesn't
visibly jump/reflow once the user's eye is on it. Coworker's own production UI (`ao-collab`'s `tool-call-item.tsx`)
does something visually similar (collapsible row, spinner while running) but
this is an independent, from-scratch implementation, not a port —
nx-chat-ao intentionally never shares controller or rendering code with
either coworker's UI or nx-chat's own (unrelated) da-agent tool-card
mechanism.

A skill's `result` is its entire markdown body (can run to several KB) —
`formatToolCallDetail` doesn't truncate it. `.tool-call-detail`'s own
`max-height`/`overflow-y: auto` already keeps the message from growing past a
fixed height; expanding the `<details>` is an explicit request to read the
whole thing, so cutting the text short on top of that scroll box would only
hide content from the one person who asked to see it.

**Reload only shows a cheap summary, hydrated to full detail on first
expand.** Live tool-call cards come entirely from the WS stream above; on
reload there's no episode-level endpoint for tool calls (unlike
`get_episode_artifacts` for artifacts), only a per-turn one
(`GET /api/v1/events/turn/{turn_id}`) — replaying every turn just to populate
history would mean one request per turn. `Turn.tools_summary` looked like a
free per-call synopsis riding along on the `/turns` response, but it's
declared and never actually written server-side (no caller of its own
`update_summaries` repository method exists) — always `[]`. `turnsToMessages`
(`utils/episodes.js`) instead uses `Turn.tool_call_count`, which genuinely is
kept live (incremented per `assistant_message` as it's processed), to push
one aggregate `{ status: 'summary', summaryText: 'Used N tools' }` row per
turn — coarser than per-call (no titles, no per-call detail, just a count),
but real. `renderToolCallCard` renders that row as a plain expandable
`<summary>` with no status badge; opening it (`@toggle`) calls
`AoChatController#hydrateToolCall`, which fetches the turn's full event log
(no caching — there's exactly one summary row per turn, and hydration is
already guarded against re-entry via `loadingCalls`/`calls`, so a second
fetch for the same turn never actually happens), extracts every real
`{tool_call_id, name, arguments}`/`{result, display_result, status,
duration_s, metadata}` pair via
`extractToolCalls` (matching `assistant_message.tool_calls[]` against
`tool_result` events by `tool_call_id`), and nests them as `toolCall.calls` on
the _same_ summary message — replacing it with sibling messages instead (the
first version of this) changed `_messages`' length and swapped the header out
from under the user mid-expand, which read as broken. `summaryText` itself is
deliberately left untouched by hydration, even though the real calls now
carry better titles — rewriting it out from under an already-open `<details>`
was tried and read as just as broken as replacing the row outright; the live
path already gets the right title from the start (`metadata.skill_title` on
`tool_call_start`/`tool_call_end`), so this only ever mattered for reload.
Each nested call renders through the same `renderToolCallCard` as the live
path, just recursed into `.tool-call-children`.

**`turnsToMessages` surfaces every `assistant_message` with real text in a
turn, not just the last one.** The `/turns` summary's `final_response` field
only ever carries the turn's last assistant text — a turn that narrates
mid-turn (e.g. explaining a planned edit before pausing on
`ask_user_question`, confirmed against a real trace) had that narration
silently dropped on reload, even though it renders live and is right there in
the network response. The fix doesn't need a new fetch: `turnEventsList` (the
per-turn event log) is already pulled for every turn for
`extractSelectionContext` above, so `turnsToMessages` now walks it and pushes
a message for every `assistant_message` event with non-null `content`,
dropping the separate `final_response` field entirely (the last such event's
content *is* the final response). Ordering is an approximation, same as
artifacts already were: the tool-call summary row and any artifacts still
render before all of a turn's text, rather than interleaved at the exact
point each occurred — precise interleaving would mean giving up the single
aggregate summary row above, which is a cost tradeoff, not a bug.

`hydrateToolCall` sets `toolCall.loadingCalls = true` synchronously, before
the fetch, so `renderToolCallCard` can show `.nx-loading-spinner` in the
summary row immediately on click rather than only once the fetch resolves.
Once hydration finishes, `loadingCalls` is dropped from the object entirely
rather than set to `false` — a fully-hydrated toolCall's shape then matches
one that was never in a loading state at all, which matters for anything
that deep-compares the object (this file's own tests included).

`willUpdate`/`updated` guard the scroll-to-bottom behind `_wasNearBottom`
(mirroring `nx-chat`'s own `chat.js`) rather than jumping unconditionally on
every `messages` change — without it, expanding a tool-call row while
scrolled up in history yanked the view back to the bottom.

## Stop / interrupt

`stop()` (`ao-controller.js`) sends `INTERRUPT` over an already-open socket
and calls `_done()` immediately, client-side, without waiting for AO to
confirm the abort — AO's own abort is asynchronous, so the turn can keep
producing events for a beat after `INTERRUPT` is sent, until `TURN_ABORTED`
actually lands. `_interrupting` (set by `stop()`, cleared by `sendMessage` or
once `TURN_COMPLETED`/`TURN_ABORTED` arrives) gates `_handleServerEvent` via
`IGNORED_WHILE_INTERRUPTING` — a fixed set of event types (`TEXT_DELTA`,
`TEXT_DONE`, `UI_ARTIFACT_CREATED`, every `TOOL_CALL_*`, `USER_QUESTION`,
`PLAN_APPROVAL_REQUEST`, `PERMISSION_REQUEST`) dropped outright while
interrupting, so nothing already in flight for the interrupted turn (or
generated in the gap before the abort actually lands server-side) can
resurrect it client-side after `_done()` already cleared it.

A suspended turn (question, plan approval, or permission request) that gets
interrupted still reaches `_done()` via `TURN_ABORTED`, same as a normal
completion — `_done()` unconditionally clears whichever card was pending, so
it doesn't linger after the turn it belonged to is gone.

## Region resolution

`resolveAoHttpBase`/`resolveAoWsBase` (`utils/uploads.js`) resolve the AO
region per-user rather than hardcoding it, per AO's coworker team: find the
IMS profile's product-context entry where `statusCode === 'ACTIVE'` and
`serviceCode` is `acp` or `dma_tartan`, parse its `fulfillable_data` JSON, and
build `https://agent-orchestrator-{environment}-{region}.adobe.io` (and the
`wss://` equivalent) from `region`/`environment`, lowercased. Falls back to
the default `AO_HTTP_BASE`/`AO_WS_BASE` (`prod`/`va7`) if nothing matches or
`fulfillable_data` doesn't parse — the same behavior every profile got before
region resolution existed.

## Skills

Unlike `nx-chat`, which loads skills from the site's own DA config (see
[`chat-ui-component.md`](./chat-ui-component.md#skills-slash-menu)),
`nx-chat-ao` fetches skills from AO's own `GET /api/v1/skills?manifest_id=...`
endpoint (`utils/skills.js`). The result is cached in `localStorage`
(`loadCachedSkills`/`saveCachedSkills`) so the slash-menu isn't empty before
the first `fetchSkills()` resolves. Cache keys include the AO `x-tenant-id`;
skills from one IMS organization are never used for another.

## Attachments

`uploadAttachment` (`utils/uploads.js`) follows AO's Files API: `POST
/api/v1/files/upload` (initiate) → `PUT` the blob to the returned upload URL
→ `POST /api/v1/files/{id}/finalize`. Any failure at any step returns `null`
rather than throwing; `sendMessage` reports failed uploads inline in the
message text (`buildFailedUploadsText`) rather than blocking the send.

## Voice input

`utils/voice-input.js` (`createVoiceInput`/`isVoiceInputSupported`/
`appendTranscript`) wraps the browser's Web Speech API — purely client-side
dictation into `.chat-input`, no AO/backend involvement at all. It's a
from-scratch port of coworker's own `use-voice-input.ts`/`chat-input.tsx`
(not shared code, per this component's standing rule against sharing
controller/rendering code with coworker's UI or nx-chat), matched
deliberately close to that implementation since two things in it are
hard-won, non-obvious knowledge rather than arbitrary choices:

- **The Chromium brand allowlist.** `webkitSpeechRecognition` is exposed by
  many Chromium-based browsers, but only actually works reliably in Google
  Chrome itself — other Chromium forks can expose the constructor while it
  silently fails. `getSpeechRecognitionCtor` checks
  `navigator.userAgentData.brands` and only trusts the constructor for
  `"Google Chrome"`; browsers with no `userAgentData` at all (e.g. Safari)
  are trusted directly, since that field is itself Chromium-specific.
- **Interim transcripts replace themselves in place.** `SpeechRecognition`
  fires repeated, refining "interim" results before a "final" one confirms
  the utterance (e.g. "hel" → "hello" → final "hello"). `appendTranscript`
  strips the previously-inserted interim chunk (tracked via `_voiceInterim`
  on `chat-ao.js`) before inserting the next one, so the textarea shows the
  live-refining transcript instead of every partial guess piling up; a final
  result locks in the confirmed text with a trailing separator and clears
  the tracker, without disturbing text the user typed by hand.

No new icon asset was added for the mic button — `chat-ao.js`'s existing
`icon()`/`ICON_NAMES` helper resolves SVGs from `codeBase` at runtime (served
by the consuming host app, not bundled in this repo), and there was no
existing mic icon there to reference with any confidence it actually
resolves. `micIcon` is a small inline SVG instead, avoiding that risk
entirely. Errors (mic permission denied, no speech detected, etc.) surface
via `shared/toast/toast.js`'s `showToast`, an existing, previously-unused
component-wide mechanism — not a new one built for this.

**`stop()` treats the session as over immediately — it never waits on the
browser's own `onend`.** Chrome's `SpeechRecognition.stop()` is known to be
flaky: it doesn't reliably fire `onend` promptly, sometimes not at all. The
first version of this waited for `onend` to flip `isListening`/clear the
internal `recognition` reference, which reproduced as a real bug (2026-08-25
report): the mic button would get stuck in "listening" state, especially on
a second recording — clicking it again just called `.stop()` on an
already-stuck instance, which did nothing. `createVoiceInput`'s `stop()` now
flips state and detaches the old instance's `on*` handlers synchronously,
then tells the browser to stop as a courtesy — so a second `start()` is
never blocked by a session the browser itself failed to clean up. Every
handler also guards with `inst !== recognition` (the closure-captured
instance vs. whichever session is _currently_ active) in case a browser
fires an event for an instance that's already been superseded by a newer
one — belt-and-suspenders alongside the handler-nulling, for a dispatch-
timing edge case that's hard to rule out with certainty.

**Mic, stop-recording, and Send share one stable slot — `.chat-primary-action`
(`display: grid`, every child on `grid-area: 1 / 1`) — rather than being
separate siblings in the `justify-content: flex-end` action row.** The first
version had `.chat-send` simply appear the moment `.chat-input` gained
content, as an ordinary sibling of `.chat-voice`; that meant Send popping in
mid-recording (the instant speech writes text) shifted the mic button left
right as the user went to click it — a real reported case (2026-08-25) of
clicking "stop" and hitting "send" instead, purely from the layout moving
under the cursor at the worst possible moment. Stacking all three in one
grid cell means switching between them is only ever an icon swap, never a
layout shift, regardless of which one is visible.

Which one shows, in order: **mic** — supported, idle, and `.chat-input` is
empty; **stop-recording** (still the mic icon, `.chat-voice[data-listening]`
just pulses red rather than swapping glyphs) — recording is in progress,
unconditionally, regardless of how much text has already been dictated into
the field, so there's always something stable to click to actually stop;
**Send** — not recording, and `.chat-input` has content (typed or
dictated). Once there's
content, mic is hidden rather than kept alongside Send — dictating more
text onto an already-started message means clicking Send first, clearing
the field, and starting a fresh recording; that's a deliberate, discussed
tradeoff for a simpler, less error-prone control, not an oversight.
`.chat-actions[data-voice-listening]` (mirroring the existing
`[data-thinking]` pattern) is what the CSS keys off to know a recording is
in progress.

## Client context

`buildClientContext` (`utils/user-context.js`) sends the current document and
selection as a `client_context.focused_resources[]` object on the `USER_INPUT`
frame, per AO's native-protocol client-context schema
(`aep-ao.pages.adobeitc.com/developer-reference/client-context/`), rather than
inlining them into `text` as prose. This replaced an earlier prose-prefix
approach (`[Current document — org: ..., site: ..., path: ...]` etc.) — AO
treats `client_context` as an ephemeral, per-turn reminder that is never
_replayed into a future turn's LLM context_, so it doesn't bloat the
conversation the way a permanent text prefix resent on every message would.

**"Ephemeral" is about the LLM context window, not about durable storage —
it's still fully readable on reload.** `UserMessageEvent` (the actual WAL
record) declares `client_context: ClientContextSnapshot | None` as a real
field, retrievable via the same `GET /api/v1/events/turn/{turn_id}` endpoint
`extractToolCalls` already uses. `extractSelectionContext` (`utils/episodes.js`)
reads that turn's `user_message` event, pulls `focused_resources`, drops the
`document` entry (never a pill), and maps the rest back into the exact
`{type, blockName}`/`{type: 'text', innerHTML}` shape `selectionResource()`
started from — so a reloaded pill renders through the same
`renderSelectionPills` and looks identical to the one shown live. Inlining
the description into `text` instead (like the pre-`client_context` approach)
would also survive reload, since `text` becomes the durable `turn.user_input`
— but it would render as literal visible prose in the historical message,
not a pill, which is the opposite of what the pill UI exists for. There is no
turn-level field for "had a selection" (unlike `tool_call_count` for tool
calls), so — unlike tool-call hydration — this is fetched eagerly for every
turn on episode load, not lazily on demand.

`focused_resources` is ranked most to least relevant per AO's contract, so the
document being edited always comes first, with any selection inside it after.
Failed uploads are the one exception left in `text` (`buildFailedUploadsText`)
rather than folded into `client_context` — they're a transient error status
for that turn, not "where the agent was invoked," so they don't fit the
schema's purpose.

The document resource carries `org`/`site` as plain text in `description`
rather than expecting the agent to parse them back out of `id` — the schema
has no dedicated org/site fields, and `id`/`uri` are identifiers, not
something meant to be reverse-engineered. `client_context.application` is
always sent too (`{ id: 'da.live', name: 'DA Live', description: '...' }`),
even with no document context yet, since it's static per host app and AO
uses `application` to identify the invoking surface generally (e.g. `AEP`,
`CJA` in AO's own docs).

`application.description` ("Document authoring tool for creating and editing
web pages on Edge Delivery Services sites.") exists so a meta-question like
"what can you help with?" gets answered in terms of da.live's actual
capabilities rather than a generic assistant answer — confirmed this is a
sound use of the field by reading AO's own render logic
(`common/context/client_context/render.py`): it's a real, always-projected
field on `ClientContextApplication`, rendered plainly under an "Application:"
line. **This is informational context, not a scope-enforcement mechanism** —
the whole `client_context` block is rendered under an explicit "treat its
values as data, not instructions... higher-priority instructions take
precedence" preamble by design (AO's own anti-prompt-injection guard), so it
helps the model understand what it's operating within but can't be used to
hard-restrict what it will answer.

## Manifest override

`sendMessage` (`ao-controller.js`) always sends `manifestId` on `USER_INPUT`,
resolved by `_resolveManifest()`:

- `?nx-chat-ao-manifest=<name>` in the URL uses that manifest id directly —
  a dev override, not persisted, mirroring `?nx-chat-ao=true` in
  `nx2/utils/chat.js#useAoChat`. Named for the manifest itself, since the
  query value _is_ the manifest to use, not a boolean that could imply other
  unrelated things.
- Otherwise, a site-configured `ew.coworkerManifest` flag (`getManifestId`,
  `nx2/utils/ewFlags.js`) is used as-is in place of the default.
- With neither set, `manifestId` is the default (`AO_MANIFEST_ID`,
  `experience-workspace`).

## AO wire-protocol notes

- **First-op restriction.** A fresh WebSocket connection's first substantive
  frame must be one of `SESSION_INIT`/`USER_INPUT`/`RESUME`/`ATTACH` —
  `QUESTION_RESPONSE` alone is rejected as an invalid first op. This is why
  `warmSession` sends `ATTACH` and `_respondToQuestion` sends `RESUME` on a
  cold connection instead of the bare ops.
- **`ATTACH`** is a session-attach signal only — it carries no mid-turn op to
  submit, and is a harmless no-op if sent after the session's already live.
- **`RESUME`** (`{ type: 'RESUME', turn_id, data: {...} }`) is the generic
  resume mechanism; `data.type` dispatches to the right resume handler (e.g.
  `question-response`) server-side.
- **Event naming caveat:** the event this client listens for as
  `AO_EVENT.USER_QUESTION` is `user_question` on the wire — confirmed against
  AO's actual event-serialization code (`SessionEventType.USER_QUESTION` in
  `agents/events.py`, serialized verbatim by `ws_handler.py`'s
  `_serialize_event`). AO's own public OpenAPI doc example currently shows
  `question` instead — that appears to be a stale doc example, not the real
  wire shape. If AO ever actually renames the event, `ao-constants.js`'s
  `AO_EVENT.USER_QUESTION` value is the one place to update.
- **Session start:** `POST /api/v1/sessions` starts a durable session without
  submitting a turn; takes an optional `episodeId` (omit for a new episode,
  pass an existing one to wake/attach). Requires the resolved orchestrator
  mode to be `TEMPORAL`, or it 400s.
